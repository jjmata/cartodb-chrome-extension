# CartoDB Chrome extension

This Chrome extension allows to import data tables into CartoDB with one click. It does its best in order to parse html tables, be understanding with its limitations ;)

## Installation

In order to try it, clone this repo and in Chrome pick More tools --> extensions, enable 'Developer mode' and click 'Load unpacked extension...' choosing the 'src' directory.

## Usage

Click the icon in order to set your user and apikey.

You will see CartoDB icon on top of every table that we think you'd like to import to CartoDB. If there's a table without the icon you can right click on it.
