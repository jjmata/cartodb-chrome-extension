# CartoDB Chrome extension

This Chrome extension allows to import data tables into CartoDB with one click. It does its best in order to parse html tables, please be understanding with its limitations ;) If you report any table that doesn't work as you expected we'll try to improve the extension. And you can contribute as well, too :-)

## Installation

### The hard way, if you want to contribute

Clone this repo and in Chrome pick More tools --> extensions, enable 'Developer mode' and click 'Load unpacked extension...' choosing the 'src' directory.

### The easy way, for everybody else

Click <a href="https://github.com/juanignaciosl/cartodb-chrome-extension/raw/master/dist/latest/cartodb-chrome-extension.crx">download link</a> in Chrome. Open <a href="chrome://extensions">Extensions</a> and drop it from your download folder (Chrome has disabled direct installations because of security concerns).

## Usage

Click the icon in order to set your user and apikey.

You will see CartoDB icon on top of every table that we think you'd like to import to CartoDB. If there's a table without the icon you can right click on it.
