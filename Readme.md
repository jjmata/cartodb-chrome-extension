# CartoDB Chrome extension

This Chrome extension allows to import data tables into CartoDB with one click. It does its best in order to parse html tables, be understanding with its limitations ;)

## Usage

Right now this is configured only for [staging](https://rabo.cartodb-staging.com/u/kartones2/dashboard/tables).

In order to try it, clone this repo and in Chrome pick More tools --> extensions, enable 'Developer mode'Âand click 'Load unpacked extension...' choosing the 'src' directory.
